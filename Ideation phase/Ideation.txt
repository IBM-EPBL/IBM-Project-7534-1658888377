A Novel Method for Handwritten Digit Recognition System

              Humans can visually sense the world around them by using their sensory organs and brain. Computer vision works on enabling computers to see and process images in the same way that human vision does. Several algorithms developed in the area of computer vision to recognize images. The goal of this work is to create a modle to identify and determine the handwrittrn digits from its datasets with better accuracy and aim to complete this by using the concept of Convolutional Network and MNIST dataset. A method called Soft Max Regression is used for assigning the probabilities to handwritten digits. Though the goal is to create a modle which can recognize digits but can extend for letters and then a person's handwriting.Through this work,people can learn and practically apply the concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks.
