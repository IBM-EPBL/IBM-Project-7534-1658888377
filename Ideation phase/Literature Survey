        "Flexible, high performance convolutional neural networks for image classification" in 
        Twenty-second International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2011 by 
        D.C.Ciresan, U.Meier, J.Masci, L.M.Gambardella, and J.Schmidhuber.
   
   It is pretty challenging to get a good performance as more parameters are needed for the 
   large scale neural network. Many researchers are trying to increase the accuracy with less 
   error in CNN.
   
   In another research, they have shown that deep nets perform better when they are tarined 
   by simple back-propagation. Their architecture results in the lowest error rate on MNIST compared 
   to NORB and CIFAR10.
